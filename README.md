# RWTH ML Boot Camp

This repository holds the codes for the PyTprch examples to be used in the Boot Camp.

## Dataset

For the examples, we will be using the famous MNIST dataset, which is large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

## Convolutional Neural Network

To showcase the power of convolutional neural networks to handle images, we use the `cnn.py` scrip. The script objective is to load and train a simple CNN on the MNIST dataset,
with the objective of classify the digits from one to 9.

## Auto-encoders

we also showcase how auto-encoders are able to compress and reconstruct the MNIST data. We show the examples of a AR using MLPs and using CNN which showcase a much more improved performance.
